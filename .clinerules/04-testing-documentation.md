# Testing and Documentation Standards

## Testing Guidelines

- Write unit tests for critical functions and business logic
- Use React Testing Library for component tests
- Aim for high test coverage on core functionality
- Test edge cases and error scenarios
- Implement integration tests for API endpoints
- Add E2E tests for critical user flows

## Documentation Requirements

- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions and components
- Document component props and return types clearly
- Keep comments concise and meaningful
- Update documentation alongside code changes
- Maintain README.md with current project capabilities
- Document API changes and breaking changes

## Code Comments

- Use TypeScript's type system as primary documentation
- Add comments for complex business logic
- Explain "why" not "what" in comments
- Remove outdated or redundant comments
- Use TODO comments sparingly and track them
