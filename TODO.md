# Project TODO: Prioritized Backlog

## 🟥 Critical
- [ ] **HTTPS Enforcement**: Redirect all production traffic to HTTPS (`SecurityProvider.tsx`).
- [ ] **Dependency Audit**: Regularly run `npm audit` and update dependencies for vulnerabilities.
- [ ] **External Links**: Ensure all external links use `rel="noopener noreferrer"` and validate URLs.
- [ ] **Sensitive Data Handling**: Review session/local storage usage and clear sensitive data on tab hide/close.

## 🟧 High
- [ ] **Accessibility**: Add ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and semantic HTML for all interactive elements.
- [ ] **Testing**: Add or expand unit/integration tests for critical components and pages.
- [ ] **Performance**: Monitor Core Web Vitals (Lighthouse, Vercel Analytics). Optimize images, fonts, and static assets.
- [ ] **CORS Policy**: Restrict CORS origins in `vite-security.config.ts` for production.

## 🟨 Medium
- [ ] **Bundle Size**: Keep all chunks < 300kB. Review `BUNDLE_OPTIMIZATION.md` for improvements.

- [ ] **Security Blog Series**: Publish advanced security guides (Zero Trust, DLP, remote work, etc.).
- [ ] **API Security**: If adding backend APIs, implement rate limiting, input validation, and monitoring.
- [ ] **Internationalization (i18n)**: Add support for multiple languages if targeting a global audience.

## 📋 Documentation & Dev Experience
- [ ] **Update README**: Add architecture overview, contribution guidelines, and security contact.
- [ ] **Deployment Docs**: Keep `DEPLOYMENT.md` up-to-date with optimizations and troubleshooting.
- [ ] **Changelog**: Maintain a `CHANGELOG.md` for releases and major changes.
- [ ] **Issue Templates**: Add GitHub issue/PR templates for collaboration.
