# Project TODO: Improvements, Security Updates, and Future Features

## 🛠️ General Improvements
- [ ] **Bundle Size**: Continue monitoring and optimizing bundle size (target: all chunks < 300kB). Review `BUNDLE_OPTIMIZATION.md` for further splitting and dependency reduction.
- [ ] **Component Reuse**: Audit for duplicate UI logic/components. Further modularize where possible (see `REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md`).
- [ ] **Accessibility**: Ensure all interactive elements have ARIA labels, proper keyboard navigation, and semantic HTML.
- [ ] **Performance**: Use Lighthouse and Vercel Analytics to monitor Core Web Vitals. Optimize images (WebP, lazy loading), fonts (`font-display: swap`), and static assets.
- [ ] **Testing**: Add or expand unit/integration tests for critical components and pages.

## 🔒 Security Updates
- [ ] **Security Headers**: Confirm all recommended headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy) are enforced in both `vercel.json` and runtime (`security-headers.ts`).
- [ ] **HTTPS Enforcement**: Ensure all production traffic is redirected to HTTPS (see `SecurityProvider.tsx`).
- [ ] **External Links**: Use `rel="noopener noreferrer"` and validate URLs for all external links.
- [ ] **Sensitive Data Handling**: Review session/local storage usage. Clear sensitive data on tab hide/close.
- [ ] **Dependency Audit**: Regularly run `npm audit` and update dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
- [ ] **CORS Policy**: Review and restrict CORS origins in `vite-security.config.ts` for production.
- [ ] **MFA/Authentication**: If user accounts are added in the future, implement MFA and secure authentication flows.
- [ ] **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Consider a strict CSP to mitigate XSS risks.

## 🚀 Future Features & Enhancements
- [ ] **Search Improvements**: Enhance blog search with fuzzy matching, tag filtering, and search suggestions.
- [ ] **Blog Features**: Add comments (with moderation), post sharing, and author profiles.
- [ ] **RSS Feed**: Ensure RSS feed is up-to-date and discoverable.
- [ ] **Dark/Light Mode**: Expand theme support and allow user preference persistence.
- [ ] **Analytics**: Integrate privacy-respecting analytics (e.g., Plausible, Vercel Analytics).
- [ ] **Admin Panel**: (If needed) Build a secure admin dashboard for content management.
- [ ] **User Accounts**: (Optional) Add user registration, profiles, and role-based access control.
- [ ] **Security Blog Series**: Continue publishing advanced security guides (Zero Trust, DLP, remote work, etc.).
- [ ] **API Security**: If adding backend APIs, implement rate limiting, input validation, and monitoring.
- [ ] **Internationalization (i18n)**: Add support for multiple languages if targeting a global audience.

## 📋 Documentation & Dev Experience
- [ ] **Update README**: Add project architecture overview, contribution guidelines, and security contact.
- [ ] **Deployment Docs**: Keep `DEPLOYMENT.md` up-to-date with new optimizations and troubleshooting steps.
- [ ] **Changelog**: Maintain a `CHANGELOG.md` for tracking releases and major changes.
- [ ] **Issue Templates**: Add GitHub issue/PR templates for better collaboration.
