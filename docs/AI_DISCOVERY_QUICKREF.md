# AI Discovery Quick Reference

## 🚀 What Was Built

### New Endpoints
- **`/ai.txt`** - AI crawler access policy and usage rules
  - Location: `src/app/ai.txt/route.ts`
  - Purpose: Tell AI services how they can use your content

### Enhanced Endpoints
- **`/robots.txt`** - Now includes AI-specific crawler rules
  - Location: `src/app/robots.ts`
  - Added: GPTBot, Claude-Web, Google-Extended, CCBot, etc.

### Structured Data (JSON-LD)
All pages now include machine-readable metadata:

| Page | Schema Type | Fields |
|------|-------------|--------|
| `/` | WebSite, Person, WebPage | Site info, author info, professional details |
| `/blog/[slug]` | Article | Title, author, dates, keywords, word count |
| `/projects` | CollectionPage + ItemList | Projects with tech stack, status, links |

## 🎯 Key Features

### 1. AI Access Control
```
✅ Allow: Public content (blog, projects, about)
✅ Allow: AI training with attribution
✅ Allow: Commercial use
❌ Disallow: API endpoints
❌ Disallow: Contact form (spam prevention)
```

### 2. Attribution Requirements
When AI cites your work:
```

```

### 3. Supported AI Services
- OpenAI (ChatGPT/GPT-4)
- Anthropic (Claude)
- Google (Gemini/Bard)
