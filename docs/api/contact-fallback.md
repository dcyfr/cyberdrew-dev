# Contact API Email Fallback

**Implementation Date:** October 20, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

## Overview

The contact form API (`/api/contact`) now gracefully handles missing `RESEND_API_KEY` configuration instead of returning a 500 error. This ensures a better user experience when the email service is not configured.

## Implementation Details

### Backend Changes (`src/app/api/contact/route.ts`)

1. **Configuration Check**
   ```typescript
   const RESEND_API_KEY = process.env.RESEND_API_KEY;
   const isEmailConfigured = !!RESEND_API_KEY;
   const resend = isEmailConfigured ? new Resend(RESEND_API_KEY) : null;
   ```

2. **Early Return with Graceful Message**
   - Before attempting to send email, checks if Resend is configured
   - Logs the submission for manual follow-up
   - Returns 200 status with success message and warning flag
   - Includes helpful message about contacting via alternative channels

3. **Response Structure (when email unavailable)**
   ```json
   {
     "success": true,
     "message": "Message received. However, email service is not configured. Please contact me directly via social media or GitHub.",
     "warning": "Email delivery unavailable"
   }
   ```

### Frontend Changes (`src/app/contact/page.tsx`)

1. **Warning Toast**
   - Checks for `warning` flag in successful responses
   - Shows warning toast instead of success toast when email is unavailable
   - Maintains form submission flow and user feedback

2. **User Experience**
   - Form still resets after submission
   - User receives clear feedback about the situation
   - Alternative contact methods are suggested

## Behavior Comparison

### Before (Missing API Key)
- ❌ Returns 500 Internal Server Error
- ❌ Generic error message to user
- ❌ No logging of submission data
- ❌ Poor user experience

### After (Missing API Key)
- ✅ Returns 200 Success with warning
- ✅ Clear message about email unavailability
- ✅ Submission logged to console for manual follow-up
- ✅ Suggests alternative contact methods
- ✅ Form submission completes successfully

### With API Key (Normal Operation)
- ✅ Email sent via Resend
- ✅ Success toast shown
- ✅ Standard confirmation message

## Testing

### Test Without API Key
1. Remove or comment out `RESEND_API_KEY` in `.env.development.local`
2. Restart dev server
3. Submit contact form
4. Should see warning toast with alternative contact suggestion
5. Check terminal logs for submission data

### Test With API Key
1. Ensure `RESEND_API_KEY` is set in environment
2. Restart dev server
3. Submit contact form
4. Should receive email and see success toast

## Logging

When email service is unavailable, submissions are logged with:
```javascript
{
  name: "User Name",
  email: "user@example.com",
  message: "User message content",
  timestamp: "2025-10-20T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

This allows manual follow-up via the logged contact information.

## Future Enhancements

Consider adding:
- Alternative notification methods (Slack webhook, Discord, etc.)
- Database persistence of contact submissions
- Admin dashboard for viewing submissions
- Email queue for retry logic
- Multiple email provider fallback chain
