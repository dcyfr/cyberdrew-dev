## Implementation Details

### Next.js Metadata API

All pages use Next.js 15's Metadata API:

```typescript
import type { Metadata } from "next";

const pageDescription = "Your optimized description here";

export const metadata: Metadata = {
  description: pageDescription,
  openGraph: {
    description: pageDescription,
    // ... other OG properties
  },
  twitter: {
    description: pageDescription,
    // ... other Twitter card properties
  },
};
```

**Key Points:**
- Use the same description for `description`, `openGraph.description`, and `twitter.description`
- Store in a constant for reusability (JSON-LD, content consistency)
- Include comment with character count for future updates

### Blog Posts (Dynamic Metadata)

Blog posts use `generateMetadata` with frontmatter summary:

```typescript
export async function generateMetadata({ params }): Promise<Metadata> {
  const { slug } = await params;
  const post = posts.find((p) => p.slug === slug);
  
  return {
    title: post.title,
    description: post.summary, // From frontmatter
    // ...
  };
}
```

**Guidelines for Blog Post Summaries:**
- Write summaries during post creation
- 120-160 characters ideal
- Standalone sentence (no "This post..." phrasing)
- Include key topics/takeaways
- Front-load important keywords
