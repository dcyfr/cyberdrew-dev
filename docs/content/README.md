   - Content based on actual experiences
   - Not theoretical "best practices"
   - Code examples from production

   - Posts build on each other
   - Readers can start anywhere
   - Series creates reader loyalty

3. **Three Pillars, Not Topics**
   - Coherent coverage area
   - Clear audience
   - Balanced output

4. **Practical Over Theoretical**
   - "Here's what I learned"
   - "Here's how you implement it"
   - "Here's what to watch for"

   - AI augments humans
   - Not about automation for its own sake
   - Real workflows and patterns
