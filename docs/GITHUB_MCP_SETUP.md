# GitHub MCP Setup & Getting Started

**Implementation Date**: October 18, 2025  
**Current Status**: ‚úÖ Configured (Awaiting First Use)

## Overview

You now have GitHub's official MCP Server integrated into your development environment. This guide walks you through setting it up for first use.

## Before You Start

### Requirements Checklist
- [ ] Docker is installed on your machine
- [ ] Docker app can be launched (`/Applications/Docker.app` on macOS)
- [ ] GitHub account with repository access
- [ ] VS Code 1.101 or later

### Quick Environment Check
```bash
# Check Docker installation
docker --version

# Verify VS Code version
code --version
```

## Step 1: Create GitHub Personal Access Token

**Time**: 2-3 minutes

1. Navigate to: https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new

2. Fill in the form:
   - **Token name**: `cyberdrew-dev-mcp` (or your preferred name)
   - **Expiration**: 90 days (balances security and convenience)
   - **Description**: "MCP Server for VS Code AI assistants"

3. Select scopes based on what you need:
   
   **For General Development** (recommended):
   ```
   ‚òë repo (full control of repositories)
   ‚òë read:org (read organization data)
   ‚òë read:discussion
   ‚òë workflow (manage Actions)
   ```
   
   **For Full Features**:
   ```
   ‚òë All of above, plus:
   ‚òë admin:org_hook
   ‚òë gist
   ```
   
   **Read-Only/Safe**:
   ```
   ‚òë public_repo
   ‚òë read:org
   ‚òë read:discussion
   ```

4. Click "Generate token"

5. **Copy the token immediately** - You won't see it again!
   
   ```
   Your token: ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
   ```

6. Keep it safe - you'll enter it on first use

## Step 2: Prepare Docker

**Time**: 2-5 minutes (first time only)

### A. Start Docker

**macOS**:
```bash
open /Applications/Docker.app
# Wait 30 seconds for Docker to fully start
```

**Verify Docker is running**:
```bash
docker ps
```

You should see output like:
```
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND   CREATED   STATUS    PORTS     NAMES
```

### B. Pre-pull GitHub MCP Image (Optional but Recommended)

This prevents a delay on first use:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server
```

Expected output:
```
latest: Pulling from github/github-mcp-server
[=====>                                     ] Pulling...
Status: Downloaded newer image for ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server:latest
```

## Step 3: Launch VS Code with GitHub MCP

**Time**: 1 minute

### A. Open VS Code

```bash
code /Users/drew/Desktop/dcyfr/code/cyberdrew-dev
```

### B. Toggle Agent Mode

1. Open GitHub Copilot Chat or Claude Extension
2. Look for "Agent mode" button (near the chat input)
3. Toggle it ON

### C. Enter GitHub Token (First Use Only)

1. VS Code will prompt: **"GitHub Personal Access Token"**
2. Paste the token you created in Step 1
3. VS Code stores it securely
4. GitHub MCP server initializes

### D. Verify MCP is Ready

In the MCP settings or extension panel, you should see:

```
‚úÖ context7
‚úÖ sequential-thinking
‚úÖ memory
‚úÖ filesystem
‚úÖ github ‚Üê NEW!
```

## Step 4: Test GitHub MCP

**Time**: 2-3 minutes

Try these queries in Copilot Chat:

1. **Simple test**:
   ```
   "What's the status of this repository?"
   ```

2. **List operations**:
   ```
   "Show me the recent commits"
   ```

3. **Search**:
   ```
   "Find rate limiting code in this repository"
   ```

4. **Issue operations**:
   ```
   "List all open issues"
   ```

Expected: AI responds with actual GitHub data from your repo

## Common First-Time Issues & Fixes

### Issue: "Cannot connect to Docker daemon"
**Cause**: Docker app not running  
**Fix**: 
```bash
open /Applications/Docker.app
sleep 30
# Try again
```

### Issue: "401 Unauthorized"
**Cause**: Token invalid or expired  
**Fix**:
- Verify token was copied completely
- Check token hasn't expired in GitHub settings
- Generate a new token if needed

### Issue: "MCP server won't start"
**Cause**: Missing Docker or VS Code version too old  
**Fix**:
- Update VS Code: `Code ‚Üí About Visual Studio Code`
- Ensure Docker 1.10+: `docker --version`
- Pre-pull image: `docker pull ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server`

### Issue: "Tools showing but not working"
**Cause**: Token lacks required permissions  
**Fix**:
- Verify token has `repo` scope at minimum
- Generate new token with broader permissions
- Test simpler operations first (reading vs writing)

## Security Best Practices

### Immediate
‚úÖ Token only created for this specific purpose  
‚úÖ Reasonable expiration set (90 days)  
‚úÖ Minimal necessary permissions granted  
‚úÖ Token stored securely by VS Code  

### Ongoing
- [ ] Set calendar reminder to rotate token every 90 days
- [ ] Review GitHub settings monthly
- [ ] Never share or commit token to git
- [ ] Rotate immediately if token appears compromised
- [ ] Review "Personal access tokens" in GitHub settings regularly

## What's Next?

### Immediate (First Day)
1. Test basic queries (see "Test GitHub MCP" above)
2. Try automating your most common GitHub tasks
3. Combine with other MCPs for powerful workflows

### Short Term (First Week)
- Explore different toolsets based on your needs
- Set up read-only mode for sensitive repos if needed
- Create custom tools/workflows using GitHub MCP
- Share feedback with team

### Long Term
- Integrate GitHub MCP into CI/CD processes
- Combine with Sequential Thinking for complex automation
- Use GitHub + Filesystem MCPs together for code analysis
- Build team workflows around MCP capabilities

## Command Reference

### Docker Management
```bash
# Start Docker
open /Applications/Docker.app

# Pull latest image
docker pull ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server

# List running MCP containers
docker ps | grep github

# Clean up unused images
docker image prune -a
```

### VS Code Management
```bash
# Check VS Code version (should be 1.101+)
code --version

# Reload VS Code window (Cmd+K Cmd+R)
# This refreshes MCP connections

# Check MCP settings
# Settings ‚Üí Model Context Protocol
```

### Verification
```bash
# Verify Docker daemon is running
docker ps

# Check if token is valid (requires 'gh' CLI)
gh auth status
```
