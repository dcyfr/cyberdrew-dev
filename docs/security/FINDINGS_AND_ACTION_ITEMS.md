---

## High-Priority Recommendations

### 1. Set Up CSP Violation Monitoring (Medium Priority)

**Current State:**
- CSP violations are being reported to `/api/csp-report`
- Logs are written to Vercel console
- No centralized monitoring dashboard

**Recommended Action:**
```typescript
// File: src/app/api/csp-report/route.ts
// Add Sentry integration after logging

import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nextjs";

Sentry.captureMessage('CSP Violation', {
  level: 'warning',
  extra: {
    violatedDirective: data.violatedDirective,
    blockedUri: data.blockedUri,
    documentUri: data.documentUri,
  }
});
```

**Benefits:**
- Centralized violation tracking
- Real-time alerts on high violation rates
- Historical trend analysis
- Integration with incident response

**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 hours  
**Priority:** Medium (nice to have, helpful for production monitoring)

---

### 2. Create Privacy Policy & Data Retention Documentation (Medium Priority)

**Current State:**
- PII is anonymized in logs ✅
- No explicit privacy policy documented
- Data retention periods not clearly defined
- GDPR/CCPA compliance statements missing

**Recommended Action:**

Create `/docs/privacy/PRIVACY_POLICY.md`:
```markdown
# Privacy Policy

## Data Collection
- Contact form: Name, email, message (cleared after processing)
- GitHub integration: Public contribution data (not stored)
- View counts: Anonymous post views (Redis cache, 30-day retention)

## Data Protection
- All PII anonymized in logs (email domain only)
- HTTPS encryption in transit
- No third-party data sharing
- Automatic data cleanup after 30 days

## User Rights
- No user accounts - no account deletion needed
- View counts are anonymous
- Contact form data deleted after email sent

## GDPR Compliance
- Legitimate interest for analytics
- Transparent data practices
- No automated decision making
- Contact: [your-email]@cyberdrew.dev

## CCPA Compliance
- Limited data collection
- Transparent about practices
- Contact for deletion requests
```

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 hours  
**Priority:** Medium (required for GDPR/CCPA compliance)

---

### 3. Document Security Incident Response Plan (Medium Priority)

**Current State:**
- Security monitoring in place
- No formal incident response procedure
- Ad-hoc response process

**Recommended Action:**

Create `/docs/security/INCIDENT_RESPONSE_PLAN.md`:
```markdown
# Security Incident Response Plan

## Severity Levels

### Critical (Immediate Response)
- Active data breach detected
- Unauthorized access confirmed
- Site unavailable due to attack
- Response time: <30 minutes

### High (Urgent Response)
- Known vulnerability in dependency
- Suspicious CSP violations
- Rate limit abuse detected
- Response time: <2 hours

### Medium (Timely Response)
- Minor security finding
- Dependency update available
- Configuration issue
- Response time: <24 hours

## Response Procedures

### Detection
1. Monitor Vercel logs for anomalies
2. Check CSP violations via Sentry
3. Review rate limit metrics
4. Analyze security scan results

### Assessment
1. Determine severity level
2. Identify affected systems
3. Assess user impact
4. Document findings

### Response
1. Implement mitigation
2. Notify stakeholders if needed
3. Communicate with users
4. Document actions taken

### Recovery
1. Verify issue resolved
2. Update documentation
3. Review root cause
4. Plan preventive measures

## Contact Information

**Security Lead:** [your-email]@cyberdrew.dev  
**Escalation:** [backup-contact]@cyberdrew.dev  
**Incident Channel:** [team-channel]
```

**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 hours  
**Priority:** Medium (best practice, aids incident response)

---

## Medium-Priority Recommendations

### 4. Implement CSP Level 3 Features (Low Priority)

**Current State:**
- CSP Level 2 with nonces ✅
- CSP Level 3 features available

**Enhancement Opportunity:**

```typescript
// Add 'strict-dynamic' directive (CSP Level 3)
// This allows trusted inline scripts without individually whitelisting them

const cspDirectives = [
  // ... existing directives ...
  
  // Add strict-dynamic for script-src (with nonce fallback)
  `script-src 'self' 'nonce-${nonce}' 'strict-dynamic' https:`,
  
  // Older browsers without strict-dynamic support use nonce as fallback
];
```

**Benefits:**
- Simplified script whitelisting
- Better protection against injection attacks
- Automatic upgrade path for trusted scripts
- CSP Level 3 compliance

**Browser Support:** ~90% of modern browsers  
**Estimated Effort:** 1 hour  
**Priority:** Low (nice to have, provides marginal improvement)

---

### 5. Add CSP Violation Analytics Dashboard (Low Priority)

**Current State:**
- Violations logged to Sentry ✅
- No visual analytics

**Recommended Enhancement:**

Create `/docs/security/MONITORING_SETUP.md` with:
```markdown
# CSP Violation Monitoring Setup

## Sentry Dashboard Setup

1. Create project at sentry.io
2. Get DSN
3. Add to environment variables
4. Configure alerts:
   - Alert when >10 violations/hour
   - Alert on new violation types
   - Notify on data loss issues

## Vercel Logs Analysis

```bash
# View real-time CSP violations
vercel logs --project cyberdrew-dev --since 1h

# Filter specific violations
vercel logs --project cyberdrew-dev | grep "CSP Violation"

# Search for specific blocked URIs
vercel logs --project cyberdrew-dev | grep "blocked-uri: https://evil"
```

## Creating Custom Alerts

Set up monitoring for:
- Inline scripts being blocked (security check)
- Unknown domains being blocked (potential attack)
- High violation rate (DoS indicator)
```

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 hours  
**Priority:** Low (enhances visibility, not critical)

## FAQ & Troubleshooting

### Q: Is my site ready for production?
**A:** Yes! All critical security controls are in place. The recommendations are for enhanced monitoring and compliance, not critical issues.

### Q: What if there's a security incident?
**A:** Follow the incident response plan (to be created). Check Vercel logs, CSP violation reports, and rate limit metrics for clues.

### Q: How do I verify security headers?
**A:** Visit https://securityheaders.com and enter your domain. You should see an A+ rating.

### Q: What if I can't afford Sentry?
**A:** Sentry has a free tier. You can also manually review Vercel logs, though automated monitoring is better.

### Q: Do I need a privacy policy?
**A:** Yes, if you collect any user data or track analytics. This is required for GDPR/CCPA compliance.

### Q: How often should I run security scans?
**A:** Continuously via CI/CD for code. Monthly for comprehensive audits. Quarterly for penetration testing.
