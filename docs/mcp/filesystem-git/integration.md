## Configuration

### MCP Configuration File
**Location**: `mcp.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem",
        "/path/to/cyberdrew-dev"
      ],
      "disabled": false
    },
    "git": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",

```
"Show me the structure of the components directory"
â†’ Filesystem MCP lists all components and subdirectories
```

**2. Finding Code Patterns**
```

```

**4. Directory Analysis**
```
"What files are in src/components/ui?"
â†’ Filesystem MCP provides complete listing with metadata
```

### Git MCP

#### Key Capabilities

- **Diff analysis**: Compare commits and branches
- **Branch operations**: Create, switch, delete branches
- **Status checking**: View repository status
- **Blame**: Find who changed what and when
- **Show commits**: View full commit details

#### Example Use Cases

**1. Commit History Analysis**
```
"Show recent commits related to security changes"
â†’ Git MCP analyzes log and filters relevant commits
```

**2. Change Understanding**
```

â†’ Git MCP shows differences between branches
```

**4. Documentation Generation**
```
"Generate a changelog from commits in the last week"
â†’ Git MCP gathers commit information for changelog
```

**5. Problem Investigation**
```
"When was this function added and why?"
â†’ Git MCP uses blame and show to find answers
```

4. **Memory** MCP tracks decisions and context

#### Filesystem + Context7 for Refactoring
1. **Filesystem MCP** finds all files using a pattern
2. **Context7** MCP fetches library documentation
3. **Sequential Thinking** plans refactoring strategy
4. **Filesystem MCP** applies changes safely

#### Git for Code Review
1. **Git MCP** shows diff between commits
2. **Sequential Thinking** analyzes changes
3. **Filesystem MCP** examines related files
4. **Memory** tracks review findings

## Security Considerations

### Filesystem MCP
âœ… **Safe Operations**:
- Permission validation before file operations
- Path validation to prevent directory traversal
- Respects `.gitignore` patterns
- Can exclude sensitive directories

âœ… **Configuration**:
- Limited to project root directory
- Cannot access files outside project
- All operations logged and auditable

### Git MCP
âœ… **Safe Operations**:
- Read-only for most operations by default
- No credential exposure in logs
- Works with git's own security model
- Respects `.gitignore` for visibility

âœ… **Environment**:
- Uses local git repository
- No external API calls
- Credentials managed by git
- Can use SSH keys securely

---

## Practical Examples

### Use Case 1: Understanding a Recent Change
```
User: "What changed in the rate limiting implementation recently?"

Git MCP â†’ Shows recent commits touching rate-limit.ts
Filesystem MCP â†’ Displays current rate-limit.ts
Sequential Thinking â†’ Explains the changes
```

### Use Case 2: Component Refactoring
```
User: "Find all uses of the old Button component and show me the new version"

Filesystem MCP â†’ Searches for Button imports
Filesystem MCP â†’ Shows old and new Button implementations
Sequential Thinking â†’ Plans migration strategy
Filesystem MCP â†’ Updates files safely
```

### Use Case 3: Deployment Preparation
```
User: "Show me all uncommitted changes and give me a summary"

Git MCP â†’ Shows git status and diff
Sequential Thinking â†’ Summarizes changes
Memory â†’ Tracks what's ready to commit
```

### Use Case 4: Documentation Updates
```
User: "What API routes were added in the last commit?"

Git MCP â†’ Shows last commit details
Filesystem MCP â†’ Lists new files in src/app/api
Sequential Thinking â†’ Identifies changes needing documentation
```

## Best Practices

### Filesystem MCP
1. **Always verify paths** before bulk operations
2. **Use search before edit** to confirm all files
3. **Keep backups** of important files (git helps!)
4. **Review diffs** before confirming changes
5. **Test changes locally** after filesystem operations

### Git MCP
1. **Check status** before making assumptions
2. **Review diffs** before committing
3. **Use branches** for experimental changes
4. **Document commit messages** clearly
5. **Push frequently** to backup changes

### Combined Usage
1. **Understand before acting**: Use Git + Filesystem to understand current state
2. **Plan changes**: Use Sequential Thinking to plan modifications
3. **Track decisions**: Use Memory to remember context
4. **Verify results**: Use Git to confirm changes match intent
5. **Document**: Use all MCPs together for comprehensive documentation

## Troubleshooting

### Filesystem MCP Not Working
**Problem**: "Cannot access file system"
- âœ… Verify mcp.json configuration
- âœ… Check file permissions
- âœ… Ensure path in mcp.json is correct
- âœ… Check if files are in .gitignore

### Git MCP Not Working
**Problem**: "Cannot access git repository"
- âœ… Ensure you're in a git repository
- âœ… Verify git is installed and in PATH
- âœ… Check SSH key setup if using SSH
- âœ… Verify repository is accessible

### Permission Issues
**Problem**: "Permission denied" errors
- âœ… Check file permissions with `ls -la`
- âœ… Ensure user has read/write access
- âœ… Check directory ownership
- âœ… Try with `chmod` if needed
