## Quick Start

### Available MCPs (in order of priority)

1. **Context7** - Documentation lookup
2. **Sequential Thinking** - Problem solving  
3. **Memory** - Project context tracking
4. **Filesystem** ⭐ NEW - File operations & navigation
5. **Git** ⭐ NEW - Version control operations

### Example Uses

#### Filesystem MCP
```
"What files are in src/components?"
"Find all uses of the Button component"
"Show me the current rate-limit.ts file"
```

#### Git MCP
```
"Show me recent commits related to security"
"What changed between main and preview branches?"
"When was the CSP implementation added?"
```

## Key Capabilities

### Filesystem MCP Can Do
- 📁 Browse project structure safely
- 📖 Read and display files
- ✏️ Create and modify files
- 🔍 Search for files by pattern
- 🔄 Move and rename files
- 🗑️ Delete files safely

### Git MCP Can Do
- 📜 View commit history
- 🔀 Compare branches and commits
- 📊 Analyze diffs
- 🏷️ Manage git tags and branches
- 👤 Show who changed what (blame)
- 📝 View full commit details

## Integration Examples

### Use Case 1: Feature Development Workflow
```
1. Git MCP: "Show recent commits"
   ↓ Understand context
2. Filesystem MCP: "What's in src/app/api?"
   ↓ Navigate to files
3. Sequential Thinking: "Plan the implementation"
   ↓ Think through changes
4. Filesystem MCP: "Update these files..."
   ↓ Make changes safely
5. Git MCP: "Show my changes"
   ↓ Verify everything
```

### Use Case 2: Debugging & Investigation
```
1. Git MCP: "When was rate-limit.ts last modified?"
2. Git MCP: "What changed in that commit?"
3. Filesystem MCP: "Show me rate-limit.ts"
4. Sequential Thinking: "Analyze the implementation"
```

### Use Case 3: Code Review
```
1. Git MCP: "What's in the latest commit?"
2. Filesystem MCP: "Show the modified files"
3. Sequential Thinking: "Evaluate the changes"
4. Memory: "Document findings"
```

## Next Steps

### Immediately Available
- ✅ Use Filesystem MCP for file navigation
- ✅ Use Git MCP for version control operations
- ✅ Combine with existing MCPs for powerful workflows

### Short-term
- 📋 Add GitHub MCP (PR automation)
- 📋 Add Discord MCP (notifications)

### Medium-term
- 📋 Create workflow automation
- 📋 Set up CI/CD integration

---

## Important Notes

### Configuration Location
- VS Code Config: `~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/mcp.json`
- Project Reference: `./mcp.json`

### Security
✅ Both MCPs operate locally:
- No external API calls
- No credential exposure
- Safe permission validation
- Full audit trail via git

### Offline Capability
✅ Both MCPs work offline:
- Filesystem operations don't require network
- Git operations use local repository
- Perfect for restricted environments
