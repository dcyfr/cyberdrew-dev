# Environment Configuration Implementation

**Date:** October 20, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

## Overview

Created comprehensive environment variable documentation and example configuration file to simplify project setup for developers and deployment configuration.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced `.env.example` File

- All environment variables used in the project
- Detailed inline comments explaining each variable
- Setup instructions for each service
- Behavior descriptions when variables are missing
- Quick start instructions for local development
- Production setup checklist
- Security best practices

**Structure:**
1. **Site Configuration** - Domain and URL overrides
2. **Email Configuration** - Resend API for contact form
3. **GitHub Integration** - Token for contributions heatmap
4. **Redis** - View count tracking
5. **Analytics** - Vercel Analytics and Speed Insights
6. **Development** - NODE_ENV and environment detection
7. **Quick Start Guide** - Step-by-step local setup
8. **Production Setup** - Deployment requirements

✅ **Troubleshooting** - Quick reference for common issues  
✅ **Security guidance** - Best practices documented  
✅ **Service setup** - Step-by-step instructions for each integration  

### Maintenance

✅ **Versioned** - Change log tracks updates  

## Graceful Degradation Matrix

| Variable | Without It | With It |
|----------|------------|---------|
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | ✅ Form shows<br>⚠️ Logs only<br>⚠️ User warned | ✅ Sends emails<br>✅ Full functionality |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | ✅ Heatmap works<br>⚠️ 60 req/hr<br>✅ Server cache helps | ✅ Heatmap works<br>✅ 5,000 req/hr<br>✅ More reliable |
| `REDIS_URL` | ✅ Posts load<br>❌ No view counts<br>✅ No errors | ✅ Posts load<br>✅ View counts tracked<br>✅ Full functionality |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` | ✅ Uses defaults<br>✅ Environment-based | ✅ Custom domain<br>✅ Override defaults |

## Security Improvements

**Best Practices Documented:**
1. Never commit secrets (`.env.local` is gitignored)
2. Use environment-specific keys (dev/staging/prod)
3. Rotate keys regularly (90-day recommendation)
4. Principle of least privilege (read-only when possible)
5. Strong authentication (Redis passwords, token scopes)

**Key Management:**
- GitHub token: Read-only access only (`public_repo` or `read:user`)
- Resend API: Production keys separated from testing
- Redis: Connection-level authentication required

## Developer Workflows

### Local Development
```bash
# 1. Copy example
cp .env.example .env.local

# 2. Start dev server (works immediately!)
npm run dev

# 3. Add credentials as needed
# - RESEND_API_KEY (optional for local testing)
# - GITHUB_TOKEN (optional, but helps with rate limits)
# - REDIS_URL (optional for view counts)
```

### Production Deployment
```bash
# Vercel Project Settings → Environment Variables

# Required:
RESEND_API_KEY=re_live_xxxxxxxxxxxx

# Recommended:
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_live_xxxxxxxxxxxx
REDIS_URL=redis://production-instance

# Optional:
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://cyberdrew.dev
```

## Service Integration Guides

### Resend (Email)
1. Sign up at resend.com
2. Create API key
3. Verify sending domain (production)
4. Add to environment variables
5. Test contact form

### GitHub Token
1. Settings → Developer Settings → Tokens
2. Generate new token (classic)
3. Scopes: `public_repo` OR `read:user`
4. Copy immediately (can't view again)
5. Add to environment variables

### Redis (Vercel KV)
1. Vercel Dashboard → Storage → Create KV
2. Link to project
3. Environment variables auto-added
4. Done! ✅

### Redis (Upstash)
1. Sign up at console.upstash.com
2. Create database
3. Copy connection URL
4. Add to environment variables

## Testing Procedures

### Verify Configuration
```bash
# Test contact form
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/contact \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Test","email":"test@example.com","message":"Test message"}'

# Test GitHub heatmap
curl http://localhost:3000/api/github-contributions?username=dcyfr

# Check Redis connection
# Visit blog post and check view count increment
```

### Expected Behaviors

**Without RESEND_API_KEY:**
```json
{
  "message": "Message received! Email notifications are not configured, so this message was logged for review.",
  "warning": "Email delivery is not configured."
}
```

**Without GITHUB_TOKEN:**
- Heatmap loads successfully
- Uses unauthenticated API (60 requests/hour)
- Server cache reduces API calls (5-minute cache)

**Without REDIS_URL:**
- Blog posts load normally
- No view counts displayed
- Silent graceful degradation
