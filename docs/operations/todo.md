- Use `@/*` import alias consistently
- Server components by default; mark client components with `"use client"`
- Tailwind utilities for styling (no additional CSS frameworks)
- Type everything with TypeScript strict mode

### Release Process
- Update `updatedAt` in blog post frontmatter when making content changes
- Run `npm run lint` before committing
- Test locally with `npm run build` before deploying
- Review lighthouse scores after major UI changes
