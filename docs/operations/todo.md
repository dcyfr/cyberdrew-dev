## ‚öôÔ∏è Automation & CI (Recommended backlog)

Small, low-risk automation items to pick up (prioritized):

- [ ] **GitHub Actions CI** ‚Äî Add a lightweight CI workflow that runs `npm ci`, `npm run check` (lint + typecheck), and `npm run build`. Cache node modules and `.next/cache` to speed runs.
- [ ] **Snyk scan in CI** ‚Äî Run `snyk test` as an optional step when `SNYK_TOKEN` is provided (store token in GitHub Secrets). This provides authenticated vulnerability checks and reporting.
- [ ] **Husky + lint-staged** ‚Äî Install and configure to run `prettier --write` and `eslint --fix` on staged files to keep PRs clean.
- [ ] **Dependabot / Renovate** ‚Äî Configure automated dependency update PRs (weekly) for npm packages.
- [ ] **Cache build artifacts** ‚Äî Preserve `.next/cache` between CI runs keyed by lockfile + Node version.
- [ ] **Lighthouse / Performance checks** ‚Äî Add an optional Lighthouse CI job to track performance regressions on the main branch.

These are intentionally low-risk and incremental. Prioritize `GitHub Actions CI` and `Dependabot` first.
