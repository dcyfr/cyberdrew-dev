## üìö Active Series Overview

### Series 1: Developer Portfolio ‚Äî From Shipping to Scale

**Series Tagline:** "Building a production-grade portfolio platform and learning full-stack patterns along the way."

**Overview:**
A comprehensive journey from weekend project to production platform. Each post covers a distinct technical challenge: security hardening, event-driven architecture, analytics, performance optimization, and search. Real code, real constraints, real solutions.

**Target Audience:** Full-stack developers, indie builders, developers learning advanced Next.js patterns  
**Key Themes:** Next.js, TypeScript, serverless, full-stack architecture, observability

**Series Arc:**
1. ‚úÖ **Shipping Fast** - Shipping a Developer Portfolio (Published: Sep 2025)
2. ‚úÖ **Security Hardening** - Security, Performance & Production Readiness (Published: Oct 2025)
3. üéØ **Event-Driven** - Background Jobs & Inngest (Nov 2025)
4. üéØ **Analytics** - Redis, View Counts & Trending (Feb 2026)
5. üéØ **Search** - Full-Text Search Without Elasticsearch (Apr 2026)

**Lessons Learned (from first 2 posts):**
- Server-first rendering is powerful but requires discipline
- Security hardening is continuous, not a one-time task
- Production readiness requires thinking about failure modes
- Documentation of decisions matters as much as the decisions themselves

---

### Series 2: Cybersecurity in Production ‚Äî Real Threats, Real Defenses

**Series Tagline:** "Moving beyond checkbox security to practical, defense-in-depth strategies."

**Overview:**
Deep dive into security hardening for full-stack applications. Not theoretical; based on real vulnerabilities and fixes. Covers threat modeling, defense-in-depth, compliance considerations, and lessons from production incidents.

**Target Audience:** Full-stack developers, tech leads, security-conscious builders  
**Key Themes:** Threat modeling, defense-in-depth, OWASP, DevSecOps, incident response

**Series Arc:**
1. üéØ **Foundations** - CSP & HTTP Security Headers (Dec 2025)
2. üéØ **Secrets** - Environment Variables & Secret Management (Mar 2026)

### Cybersecurity Part 3: OWASP Top 10 (June 2026)

**Working Title:** *OWASP Top 10 for Next.js: Practical Defense Against Real Attacks*

**Hook:** "The OWASP Top 10 is your roadmap to security. Here's how to defend against each one in your Next.js application."

**Outline:**

1. **What is OWASP?** (200 words)
   - OWASP Top 10 explained
   - Most critical web vulnerabilities
   - How it guides security testing
   - Version 2021 vs. 2017 changes

2. **A1: Broken Access Control** (350 words)
   - What it is: users accessing resources they shouldn't
   - Real example: accessing other user's data by ID guessing
   - Prevention: middleware, row-level security, API checks
   - Testing: attempt to access unauthorized resources
   - Code example: protected API route with auth check

3. **A2: Cryptographic Failures** (300 words)
   - Storing secrets in plaintext
   - Using outdated encryption
   - Not hashing passwords
   - Exposed credentials in version control
   - Prevention: bcrypt, environment variables, secrets rotation

4. **A3: Injection** (350 words)
   - SQL injection (ORM protection)
   - NoSQL injection (validation)
   - Command injection (avoid shell commands)
   - Prevention: parameterized queries, input validation, ORM
   - Real example: contact form validation

5. **A4: Insecure Design** (300 words)
   - Missing security requirements
   - Threat modeling not done
   - Security patterns not applied
   - Prevention: threat modeling, design review, STRIDE
   - Our threat model for the portfolio

6. **A5: Security Misconfiguration** (250 words)
   - Debug mode enabled in production
   - Default credentials not changed
   - Missing security headers
   - Verbose error messages revealing internals
   - Prevention: security headers, environment-based config

7. **A6: Vulnerable Components** (250 words)
   - Outdated dependencies with known CVEs
   - Dependencies with transitive vulnerabilities
   - Testing: Snyk, npm audit, supply chain risks
   - Prevention: regular updates, automated scanning
   - Case study: fixing a real CVE in our dependencies

8. **A7: Identification Failures** (250 words)
   - Weak authentication (predictable sessions)
   - No rate limiting on login
   - Credential stuffing attacks
   - Session fixation
   - Prevention: strong passwords, rate limiting, secure sessions

9. **A8: Data Integrity Failures** (200 words)
   - Trusting user input
   - Lack of validation on both client and server
   - Insecure CI/CD pipelines
   - Prevention: validation, code signing, secure deployment

10. **A9: Logging Failures** (200 words)
    - Not logging security events
    - Logs not monitored
    - Insufficient retention
    - Prevention: comprehensive logging, alerts, retention policy

11. **A10: SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery)** (250 words)
    - Attacker makes server fetch malicious content
    - Real example: GitHub API integration with untrusted URL
    - Prevention: URL validation, allowlists, network segmentation
    - Testing: attempting to access internal services

12. **Defense-In-Depth Architecture** (250 words)
    - Layered defenses for each vulnerability class
    - No single defense is sufficient
    - Security testing checklist
    - Common patterns across the OWASP Top 10

13. **Key Takeaways** (150 words)
    - OWASP Top 10 is your security curriculum
    - Not all 10 apply equally to your app (threat modeling)
    - Automation (Snyk, SAST) catches some, not all
    - Manual testing and code review are critical
    - Security is ongoing, not a checkbox

**Assets Needed:**
- OWASP Top 10 comparison table
- Real attack scenarios (screenshots/diagrams)
- Vulnerability examples from code
- Remediation checklist

**SEO Keywords:** OWASP Top 10, Next.js security, web application security, OWASP 2021, secure coding practices
