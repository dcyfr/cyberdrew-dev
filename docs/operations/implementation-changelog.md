## October 21, 2025 - Related Posts

**Status**: ✅ Complete

### Summary
Implemented intelligent related posts feature that suggests relevant content at the end of each blog post based on shared tags, with scoring algorithm that considers multiple factors.

### Changes
- **Related Posts Algorithm**: Server-side utility to find and rank related posts
- **Scoring System**: Ranks posts by shared tags count with bonuses/penalties

### Features
- Finds posts with matching tags automatically
- Ranks by relevance (number of shared tags)
- Featured posts get +0.5 score bonus
- Archived posts get -0.5 score penalty
- Tie-breaking by newest published date
- Displays top 3 related posts
- Shows post title, summary, tags, date, and reading time
- Smooth hover animations with "Read more" link
- Excludes current post and drafts (in production)
- Gracefully handles no related posts (hidden if none)

### Algorithm
```typescript
score = sharedTags.length
if (post.featured) score += 0.5
if (post.archived) score -= 0.5
// Sort by score DESC, then publishedAt DESC
```
