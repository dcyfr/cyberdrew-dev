# Improvement Review - 2025-10-19

## Overview
- Reviewed application structure, API routes, and supporting documentation on October 19, 2025.
- Focus areas: operational readiness, developer experience, and resiliency of external integrations.
- Findings synchronized with `README.md` and `docs/operations/todo.md` for future follow-up.

## Notable Strengths
- App Router architecture is clean with typed data loaders (`src/lib/blog.ts`, `src/data/posts.ts`).
- Security investments are evident: CSP headers, rate limiting, and comprehensive API docs.
- Recent blog/RSS improvements and GitHub heatmap caching create a compelling experience.

## Key Improvement Opportunities
- **Environment variable onboarding**: multiple docs reference a non-existent `.env.example`. Add a generated template and clarify required vs optional secrets.
- **Contact form resiliency**: when `RESEND_API_KEY` is absent, `/api/contact` still attempts to send email and returns a 500. Provide a graceful short-circuit or feature flag to prevent failed submissions.
- **GitHub API hygiene**: the GraphQL request currently sends an empty `Authorization` header when the token is missing. Omit the header entirely to avoid ambiguous upstream responses.
- **Documentation drift**: `docs/operations/deployment-checklist.md` and UI copy reference setup guides that do not exist (e.g., GitHub heatmap setup). Create matching documentation or update links.

## Suggested Next Steps
- Ship an `.env.example` (or generator script) and update the deployment checklist once available.
- Patch `/api/contact` to detect missing credentials and surface a friendly "temporarily unavailable" response while logging for follow-up.
- Adjust `src/app/api/github-contributions/route.ts` to only include the `Authorization` header when `GITHUB_TOKEN` is present; add a regression test under `scripts/test-mcp-servers.mjs` or a new lightweight check.
- Author a short GitHub heatmap setup guide in `docs/api/` or `docs/operations/` and update the React component link accordingly.

## References
- Updated `README.md` (environment setup, scripts, active focus)
- Updated `docs/operations/todo.md` (new tasks for environment quickstart, contact fallback, GitHub header hygiene)
- Deployment checklist (`docs/operations/deployment-checklist.md`) now points to correct documentation
