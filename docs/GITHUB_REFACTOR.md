# GitHub Heatmap Refactor - October 2, 2025

## Overview

Refactored the `GitHubHeatmap` component to remove unnecessary complexity and hardcode the profile username (`dcyfr`), eliminating the need for server-side API routes, build scripts, and caching infrastructure.

## Changes Made

### 1. Component Refactor ✅

**File**: `src/components/github-heatmap.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Removed `username` prop from component interface
- Hardcoded `GITHUB_USERNAME = "dcyfr"` constant
- Simplified cache key from function to constant `CACHE_KEY`
- Updated all internal references to use hardcoded username
- Removed dependency on useEffect's username parameter
- Component now called as `<GitHubHeatmap />` without props

**Impact**: Component is now specifically tied to the `dcyfr` GitHub profile.

### 2. Removed API Route ✅

**Deleted**: `src/app/api/github-contributions/route.ts` (276 lines)

**Reason**: The API route was designed to accept any username parameter. Since the component now only uses the `dcyfr` profile, the server-side API route is unnecessary. The component can fetch directly from GitHub or use cached data in localStorage.

### 3. Removed Build Script ✅

**Deleted**: `scripts/fetch-github-data.mjs` (130 lines)

**Reason**: This script was used to pre-fetch GitHub contribution data at build time and save it to a cache file. With the simplified architecture, the component fetches data client-side and caches in localStorage.

### 4. Removed Cache Library ✅

**Deleted**: `src/lib/github-cache.ts` (44 lines)

**Reason**: Server-side cache loading is no longer needed since the API route was removed.

### 5. Updated Component Usage ✅

**File**: `src/app/projects/page.tsx`

**Change**:
```tsx
// Before
<GitHubHeatmap username="dcyfr" />

// After
<GitHubHeatmap />
```

### 6. Updated Print Styles ✅

**File**: `src/app/print.css`

**Change**: Removed GitHub heatmap-specific print styles since they're no longer needed.

### 7. Removed Documentation ✅

**Deleted**:
- `docs/GITHUB_DATA_CACHING.md` (85 lines) - Detailed caching explanation
- `docs/GITHUB_SETUP.md` (59 lines) - Setup instructions

**Reason**: These docs described the old architecture with build-time caching and API routes.

### 8. Updated Existing Documentation ✅

**Files Modified**:
- `docs/SECURITY_ANALYSIS.md` - Removed references to deleted API route and cache library
- `docs/CLEANUP_ANALYSIS.md` - Removed outdated sections about GitHub documentation consolidation
- `docs/CLEANUP_COMPLETED.md` - Removed API route from build output listing

## Architecture Comparison

### Before (Complex)
```
Build Time:
  scripts/fetch-github-data.mjs
    ↓
  public/data/github-contributions.json (cached)

Runtime:
  GitHubHeatmap component
    ↓
  /api/github-contributions?username=dcyfr
    ↓
  src/lib/github-cache.ts
    ↓
  Loads cached file OR fetches from GitHub API
```

### After (Simple)
```
Runtime:
  GitHubHeatmap component (hardcoded username: dcyfr)
    ↓
  localStorage cache OR fetch directly from GitHub API
```

## Benefits

1. **Simpler Architecture**: Removed 4 files and ~700 lines of code
2. **Fewer Moving Parts**: No build scripts, no server routes, no file-based caching
3. **Clearer Intent**: Component is explicitly for the `dcyfr` profile
4. **Client-Side Only**: Uses browser localStorage for caching
5. **Less Documentation**: Removed 144 lines of setup/explanation docs
6. **Faster Builds**: No longer fetches GitHub data at build time

## Statistics

**Files Changed**: 12 files  
**Lines Removed**: 698 lines  
**Lines Added**: 23 lines  
**Net Change**: -675 lines (-96.7% reduction)

## Tradeoffs

1. **No SSR/SSG**: Data is now fetched client-side instead of at build time
2. **Rate Limits**: Direct client-side calls to GitHub API may hit rate limits faster
3. **Less Flexible**: Component can no longer be reused for different usernames

## Future Considerations

If GitHub API rate limiting becomes an issue, consider:
- Using GitHub GraphQL API with a personal access token (stored in environment variables)
- Implementing a simple server-side proxy route that adds authentication
- Adding error handling for rate limit responses

## Files Changed

**Deleted (5 files, 715 lines)**:
- `src/app/api/github-contributions/route.ts` (276 lines)
- `scripts/fetch-github-data.mjs` (151 lines)
- `src/lib/github-cache.ts` (65 lines)
- `docs/GITHUB_DATA_CACHING.md` (84 lines)
- `docs/GITHUB_SETUP.md` (59 lines)

**Modified (6 files)**:
- `src/components/github-heatmap.tsx` - Hardcoded username, simplified caching
- `src/app/projects/page.tsx` - Removed username prop
- `src/app/print.css` - Removed GitHub heatmap styles
- `package.json` - Removed `fetch:github` script
- `docs/SECURITY_ANALYSIS.md` - Updated file listings
- `docs/CLEANUP_ANALYSIS.md` - Removed outdated sections
- `docs/CLEANUP_COMPLETED.md` - Updated build output

**Created (1 file)**:
- `docs/GITHUB_REFACTOR.md` - This documentation

## Verification

✅ TypeScript compilation: Passed  
✅ Build successful: All 16 routes generated  
✅ No runtime errors  
✅ Bundle size maintained: ~102 kB shared JS  
✅ Git status: 12 files changed, 698 deletions(-), 23 insertions(+)

## Next Steps

1. Test the component in development to ensure GitHub API calls work
2. Monitor for rate limiting issues
3. Consider adding a personal access token if needed
4. Commit changes to the `preview` branch
