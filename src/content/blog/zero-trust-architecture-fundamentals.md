Zero Trust architecture represents a fundamental shift from traditional perimeter-based security to a model where trust is never assumed and verification is required from everyone trying to access resources.

## Core Principles

Zero Trust is built on several key principles:

- **Never trust, always verify** - Every user and device must be authenticated and authorized
- **Least privilege access** - Users get only the minimum access needed
- **Assume breach** - Design systems assuming attackers are already inside

## Implementation Components

A successful Zero Trust implementation includes:

- Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Network segmentation
- Continuous monitoring

## Getting Started

Begin your Zero Trust journey by inventorying your assets, mapping data flows, and implementing strong identity controls.
